# Basic C Programming Journey

Welcome to my repository dedicated to learning and practicing basic C programming! I have recently started exploring C to strengthen my programming fundamentals. In this repository, I will be documenting the problems I solve, the concepts I learn, and my overall progress as I dive deeper into C programming.

This repository will cover various foundational topics, and I'll be providing simple solutions and explanations for each one. Whether you're a beginner or someone looking for clear examples of basic C programming, feel free to explore my work!

## Topics Covered

- **Basic I/O, Data Types, and Variables**: Understanding how to handle user input and output, and working with different data types and variables in C.
- **Operations, Conditions, and Loops**: Implementing arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and loops (for, while, do-while) to control program flow.
- **Arrays and Strings**: Introduction to arrays and string manipulation, essential for handling collections of data.
- **Complexity Analysis**: Basic understanding of time and space complexity to evaluate the efficiency of algorithms.
- **Functions and Built-in Functions**: Exploring function definitions, parameter passing, and using C's built-in functions for common tasks.
- **Converting to C++**: A guide to transitioning from C to C++ by leveraging object-oriented programming concepts.
- **Brute Force and Greedy Algorithms**: Implementing brute force solutions and greedy algorithms for problem-solving.
- **Constructive Algorithms**: Developing algorithms that build solutions step by step based on problem constraints.
