# Competitive Programming Journey

Welcome to my repository where I document my progress in competitive programming (CP). Though I come from a non-CSE background, I've always been passionate about CP, and today, I've decided to dive into it! This repo will showcase the problems I solve, the algorithms I learn, and my journey of honing problem-solving skills.

As a machine learning enthusiast, I recognize that a strong foundation in problem-solving is critical to excelling in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. This repository also serves as a reflection of my growth in these fields, as I aim to deepen my understanding of ML/DL algorithms and elevate my skills to the next level.

Feel free to explore my solutions, track my progress, and contribute to discussions!
